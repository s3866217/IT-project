        <br> <b>Name</b>: Grace Moon-Tin Jiang </br>
        <br> <b>Student number</b> s3866217   </br>
        <br> <b>Email Address</b> s3866217@student.rmit.com.au   </br>
        <br> <b>Basic Background</b> </br>
        I was born in Australia and my parents are Chinese immigrants. My first language was Shanghainese which is a dialect of Chinese and I speak English fluently. I am about to complete Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Finance and minor in Business Strategy and Economic Management at UNSW.I have 2 years of work experience in retail banking services and 6 months experience in Anti-money laundering/counter terrorism financing operations at Big 4 bank.  </br>
        
        
      </p>

      <br><h1>Interest in IT </h1> </br?>
       <p>
       <br> I am interested in the cyber security or artificial intelligence area of IT which can be applied into the finance industry. Around 2 years ago, I commenced working within retail banking services at Commonwealth Bank where I assisted customers visiting the branch to open financial products. Throughout my work experience, I discovered the significance of information technology on how it transformed the traditional way of banking by offering innovative solutions to customers to increase convenience and security through online banking. Customers were able to edit settings for bank cards through the mobile application, check bank transactions instantly, transfer funds using phone numbers efficiently and also withdraw funds through the application without a physical bank card. When the majority of individuals heavily relied on technology for numerous aspects including banking, there was also a spike in fraud, scams or phishing incidents which resulted in customers losing funds. I learnt that even though technology provides strong benefits in completing activities, it is also crucial to understand how to mitigate potential risks that might arise by obtaining knowledge in cyber security. 
       </br>

       <br> I chose to come to RMIT to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology that was 100% online whilst I work full time as an Anti- Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing Operations analyst at Commonwealth Bank. My goal is to study part –time where I might complete my degree in around six years which is aligned with my career plan. After six years, I aim to obtain a managerial role in the banking industry which may require technology knowledge and technical skills thus I will be able to utilize my Bachelor degree in IT to contribute to my role. Furthermore, I have also considered developing a mobile application in around 10 years as a side business venture.  </br>
      
      <br> I expect to obtain coding and programming skills as Python, Java, SQL, and SAS which I can apply in my long term career within the Banking/Finance industry. I also intend to learn aspects of cyber security which I can apply for personal and professional purposes as I heavily rely on computers and the Internet to complete my work duties. Additionally, I hope to learn the development of Artificial Intelligence programs and understand the current progresses that have been made.   </br>

        <br> Neuroticism 44% </br>


      </p>
      The Myer-Briggs test results suggest the strengths of my mental mindset are organized, practical and planned according to being a ‘turbulent defender’ and being 59% observant. However, my weaknesses include of having higher chances of overthinking or over analyzing historical results or events as I am 79% judgmental and 60% turbulent. Additionally, I have high levels of risk aversion resulting in lack imagination for new ideas as I am 21% prospecting. Furthermore, being 58% introverted means I do usually enjoy social interactions however I would prefer a balance between working individually to allow myself for development.  
Based on Myer-Biggs test results, it might be beneficial for me to interact with those whose are on the opposite spectrum of being more prospecting to inspire me to come out of my comfort zone.  

      <p>
      
      <p>
        According to results of online learning tests, I would learn more effectively through utilizing 30% auditory and 45% visual. The results suggest that I should focus on attending online lectures where there is an individual explaining concepts and presenting diagrams. Additionally when learning technical skills throughout the course, I would benefit from participating in activities or watching videos for tutorials rather than reading written instructions.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The Big 5 Personality test suggests that I value and respect opinions of others when working with them as I am 67% on Agreeableness and 65% on Openness. The 42% on Extraversion suggests that I am initially reserved when interacting with new people but I will become more extraverted overtime once rapport is established. Overall, I am relatively self- confident in my and others abilities as I am 44% Neuroticism.   

      </p>

      <p>
        I believe I will successfully work collaboratively with my team and respect everyone opinions even though I might initially disagree with them. Initially, I might be reserved as I am slightly more introverted however I tend to open up overtime once I become comfortable. Alternatively, since my team might communicate virtually through sending messages in an online chat, I might express myself more compared to than if it were a face-to-face interaction.  
 
Whilst working on a project, I will most likely devise a plan and create due dates for parts of an assignment to be completed to stay on track. I will also be willing to make changes to ideas for the purpose of continuous improvement.  

      </p>


      <p>

      When forming a team, I believe individuals who are more extraverted will assist me to build rapport more efficiently and conveniently express myself during teamwork. Students who are proactive in making casual conversations which can be observed in online lectures, might help me enjoy and relax without overthinking while working on the project.

      <h1> IT Project Idea</h1>
      <p>   The IT project will be the development of a mobile application which allows users to communicate verbally through phone or video call with individuals with a language barrier as the application automatically translates speech from one language into another. The application also allows conversations to be recorded and downloaded with both the original and translated version for the user to attempt to learn to speak their dialogue in the other language.  However initial development costs may be high, consumers will require stable network for the translation process to work efficiently. Conversely, individuals may lose language learning abilities if they become excessively reliant on the mobile application.  
        If the Project is successful, individuals will potentially learn to speak another language more efficiently and conveniently learn dialogues they will commonly use in the new language.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The application will have the function of synchronizing phone contacts to allow the user to send messages, conduct phone calls and video calls.  
 
When 2 users attempt to communicate verbally either through phone or video call, they are able to select the language they are speaking in for the application to detect and select their preferred language for the other speaker’s speech to be translated to. For example, User 1 understands English and User 2 understands Chinese however neither of them understands both English and Chinese. Once a phone call is commenced, User 1 will select ‘English’ as the language they will be speaking in to be detected and User 2 will select ‘Chinese’ as the language to be detected. The next step is for both users to select the language preference for the other’s speech to be translated into. User 1 will select English for User 2’s speech to be translated from Chinese to English and vice versa. The translated version will be played through the phone call where everyone can hear.  

      </p>


      <p>  
        The application will utilize the user’s voice for the translated version into the other user’s preferred language. Prior when the translated version of speech is sent or played, there will be an option which could be activated for words will appear on the screen in the speaker’s preferred language as they are verbally communicated. The speaker will be able to confirm and resolve pronunciation errors by editing words if there are homographs.  

      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, users are able to record and save conversations for educational purposes of learning a new language. They will be able to listen to the conversation repeatedly afterwards where the original language version would be compared to the translated version. However, mutual approval will be required before recording is enabled. There will also be a written versions of the conversation dialogues for extra reference when practicing pronunciation and understanding meaning.  

      </p>

      <p>
        Overtime, the mobile application will also detect the user attempting to speak in the other language and send notifications for improvement progresses compared to the past or develop learning plans to memorize lines in the other language.  
        
      </p>

      <b> 
        Potential Drawbacks or Obstacles 
      </b>

      <br>
      Development costs

    </br>

<p>
  A major drawback could be the financial startup cost and complexity of producing the mobile application. 
</p>

     <br> 
Social
</br>
<p>
  Individuals might take less initiative in learning new languages or deteriorate language abilities due to reliance on translation services based on research by (Hoi, 2020). 
</p>

<br>
Consumer 

</br>
<p>
  The functionality of the application would require strong network or internet connection however if the consumer does not have those resources, the user might experience buffering or glitches.  
</p>

<br>
Technical 
</br>

<p>
  There could be cases of inaccuracy when translation if words are chosen in the wrong context

</p>

<h2>
  Tools and technologies
</h2>
<p>
  Android operating system will be used as Android contributes to around 52% of the market for mobile applications according to (Makoe and Shandu, 2018). The mobile application will be developed on open source platform with a computer software for a mobile device. The function for dialogue to appear in written form will require speech to text (STT) and Text to Speech (TTS) according to (Lorusso, Molteni and Reni, 2017) and Microsoft API may be used for translating dialogue into another language. Additionally, to build the mobile application, various platforms including Appy Pie, AppMachine or Mobile Roadie can be utilised to record verbal conversations and create reminders to learn lines in the other language.  
</p>

<h2>
  Skills required
</h2>
<p>
  The main skills required are coding for developing the User Interface (UI) which refers to the layout and design of the mobile application. Coding skills and knowledge is also required to develop activities and the activity life cycles according to (Makoe, Mpine, Shandu, Thulile, 2018). Activities refer to the functions of the mobile application and activity life cycles refer to the coding for what the mobile application will do.  

 

It is relatively feasible to develop the coding skills through lessons via a Bachelor Degree. The hardware used can be a Mac computer or laptop and software used to develop the language can be downloaded for free online.
</p>

<h2>
  Outcome  
</h2>
<p>
  If the mobile application project were to be successful, individuals might find an entertaining way of learning a new language efficiently and effectively.  People may learn in accordance to their preferred pace casually without committing to class lessons if they do not have the time available.  

  Young adults who are either working full time or studying full time can utilize the application to learn dialogues that they have spoken in the other language more conveniently. There is value gradually added as they will have higher chances of speaking consistently in another language more.  
  
  Potentially, this mobile application could be incorporated into virtual corporate meetings between parties from different nations during a video conference call. Further innovation on the application might reduce demand for language classes or translators in the market.
